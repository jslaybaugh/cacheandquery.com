<h1>About Jorin Slaybaugh</h1>

<p>I'm a husband, father, and programmer living in Wichita Falls, TX. I graduated from Midwestern State University with a B.S. in Physics in 2002. I've happily worked for Brushfire Technology since 2003.</p>

<p>This blog will serve to be a collection of all my recorded thoughts longer than 140 characters. Most posts will be considerably longer than that, but hey, if you're going to do it, you might as well do it right. Right? :-)</p>

<p>Some posts will be technical and some posts will be personal. I'm a .NET developer who deals primarily in data-driven, line of business web application development. For the most part, that means ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and SQL; but I also dabble in Ruby, Python, and MongoDB to keep from getting to comfy. This blog is hosted using Jekyll on Github.</p>

<p>When I'm not playing with technology or rambling about it here, you'll find me outside having fun with my family. I'm "jslaybaugh" on just about anything you'd want to find me on.</p>
